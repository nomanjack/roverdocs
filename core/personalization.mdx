## Themes and layout

Choose between light, dark, or auto themes and pick the density that matches your monitor setup. Preferences apply instantly and persist across sessions.

## Notification rules

1. Open **Settings → Notifications**.
2. Subscribe to chains, labels, or saved searches.
3. Pick delivery channels (in-app, Slack, or email).

## Keyboard shortcuts

Use `?` anywhere in the app to open the shortcut palette. Common examples:

- `Cmd + K` – command menu
- `Shift + /` – open search terminal
- `B` – bookmark current view

<Tip>
Encourage new teammates to export their shortcut cheatsheet and keep it nearby during the first week—they will ramp up much faster.
