## Share links

Use share links when collaborating with people outside your workspace. Links can be time-boxed, watermarked, and optionally protected with passcodes.

<Steps>
<Step title="Generate a link">
Click **Share** → **Create link**, pick the expiration window, and choose whether viewers can download attachments.
</Step>
<Step title="Track access">
Audit events appear in the activity log so you know who opened the link and when.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Internal handoffs

- Mention teammates with `@` in notes to notify them.
- Attach files or screenshots directly to timeline events.
- Promote an investigation to a **Shared View** when it graduates from ad-hoc to repeatable.

<Info>
Workspace permission groups control who can share externally. Administrators can disable public links entirely if required by compliance.
