## Why use labels

Labels give shared names to wallets, contracts, and topics so everyone can recognize them without memorizing addresses. They also power filters, saved views, and alerting rules.

- **Team-wide vocabulary** keeps investigations consistent.
- **Color-coded labels** make timelines scannable.
- **Automation hooks** let you add labels from webhooks or imports.

## Bookmarks

Bookmarks act like lightweight saved views for individuals. Use them when you need to revisit an entity, a filtered timeline, or a dashboard on a regular cadence.

<Steps>

<Note>
Labels are global while bookmarks are private by default. Promote a bookmark to a shared view when the workflow is ready for the rest of the team.
