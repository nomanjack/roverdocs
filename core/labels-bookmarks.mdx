## Labels

For any address in Rover, you can create a label that acts as another name or "alias" to the same address. By default, if an address has an ENS, we will use that name for the address instead of the raw hex.


## Create a label

There are a couple of ways to add labels to addresses. In either the [Address Table](/core/tables) or [Address Detail page](/core/detail-pages), you can create a label by clicking the <span className="font-medium text-sm bg-neutral-50 dark:bg-neutral-800 px-2 py-0.5 rounded">+Custom</span> button in the Label column.

## View your labels

To view all your labels, click your avatar in the bottom left corner of your sidebar. You will see a tab called "Labels". There, you can view, edit, or delete all of your labels.
