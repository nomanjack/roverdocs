## Column presets

Start with default presets for investigations, compliance monitoring, or treasury flows. Customize columns per saved view by reordering, renaming, or hiding them.

- Toggle chain-specific columns when you need method signatures.
- Add computed columns (e.g., USD value, variance) for at-a-glance insights.
- Save presets so the same layout loads for everyone.

## Inline actions

Hover over any row to surface quick actions: label, bookmark, export row, or open the detail page.

<Note>
Inline actions respect role-based access control. If a teammate cannot edit labels, the action is hidden automatically.
