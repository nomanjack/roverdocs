## Types of views

- **Personal views** – private dashboards for individuals to track what matters to them.
- **Shared views** – collaborative workspaces that roll up saved filters, charts, and automations.
- **Command views** – read-only snapshots used for executive reviews or compliance attestations.

## Building a view

1. Click **Create view** from the sidebar.
2. Choose a template (investigation, monitoring, or reporting) or start blank.
3. Add blocks such as tables, charts, cards, and pinned searches.
4. Assign owners and viewers to control who can edit or subscribe to alerts.

## Governance

Only owners can edit the structure of a shared view. Editors may tweak filters but cannot change automation rules.

Archive stale views to keep navigation tidy. Archived views remain searchable for auditing but no longer trigger alerts.
