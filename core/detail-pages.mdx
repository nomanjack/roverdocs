## Overview

Detail pages combine blockchain events, entity metadata, and linked files so analysts can evaluate activity without pivoting between tools. Each page collects transactions, labels, comments, and attachments for the selected wallet or smart contract.

## Key sections

- **Entity header** – shows balance summaries, risk scores, last-seen activity, and quick links to explorers.
- **Timeline** – chronological feed of transfers, contract calls, and alerts with inline filters.
- **Context panel** – pins research notes, saved queries, and files so the next reviewer can pick up the thread.

## Workflow tips

1. Start from search results or a saved view and open any address to load its detail page.
2. Apply timeline filters (chain, direction, method) to focus on the most relevant activity.
3. Add notes or labels directly from the page so the context is available for your teammates.

<Tip>
Detail pages inherit permissions from the workspace, so anyone with access to the view can audit your notes.
